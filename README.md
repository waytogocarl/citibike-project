# citibike-project

First I pulled the data from the Citi Bike Data source. I pulled a files for:
- The month of June 2020 - First Covid Summer
- The month of June 2023 - Three Years After Covid

Questions I want to Answer:
- How did total number of rides compare June 2020 to June 2023?
- Did the top stations change between these years? (Perhaps due to business/slowness of the area due to Covid restrictions)
- What are the top 5 stations in June 2020? What are the top 5 stations in June 2023?
- What is the average distance traveled by the user in June 2020? And in June 2023? How do they compare?
- Where are people picking up their bikes vs dropping them off in June 2020/June 2020? What does this tell us knowing that Covid was in full swing?
  
**Phenomenon 1: Station Popularity 2020 vs. 2023** The map on the left shows the popularity of starting stations in June 2020. The two most popular stations were Liberty Light Rail, with a start station count of 2,589, and Newport Parkway, with a start station count of 2,604. When compared to June 2023, these numbers are relatively low. This could be due to several factors, such as people being out of work and not needing to commute or individuals staying home more to avoid contracting COVID-19. In the map on the right it is clear, there is a significant increase in station usage throughout Jersey City and Hoboken as more of the world reopened after COVID-19. The start station counts at these locations increased overall in 2023, with the highest count reaching 3,623, compared to 2,604 in 2020. Notably, the Grove St Path station had the highest number of starting rides in 2023, with 3,623 trips, compared to 1,819 in 2020. This suggests that Grove St Path is a central location that may have been avoided during the height of COVID-19 or a major commuter station that saw reduced usage during the pandemic.

**Phenomenon 2: Ending Station & Trip Distance 2020 vs. 2023** When comparing the two maps below, it’s clear that overall station usage—where people end their journeys—increased significantly from 2020 to 2023. This is likely due to people avoiding major metropolitan areas during the height of COVID-19. However, I found it surprising that there wasn’t more leisure usage in 2020, given that much of the population was temporarily out of work. We can assume that the fear of catching and spreading COVID-19 kept people indoors overall. Although trip distances remained high in 2020, with the longest averaging nearly 9.5 miles—only 2 miles shorter than the highest average in 2023—those who did use Citi Bikes, whether for work or leisure, still took long rides. They just weren’t ending their journeys in busy metro neighborhoods.
